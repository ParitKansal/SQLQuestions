## ðŸ§  Problem Description

You are given a table `Players` with player names and a table `Championships` that records the winners of all four major tennis tournaments â€” **Wimbledon**, **French Open (Fr_open)**, **US Open (US_open)**, and **Australian Open (Au_open)** â€” for each year.

Write an SQL query to report the number of **grand slam titles** each player has won.
A playerâ€™s total count includes wins across all years and all tournaments.

Return the result table ordered by:

1. The number of titles in **descending** order, and
2. The playerâ€™s name in **ascending** order if thereâ€™s a tie.

### **Return Format**

| player_id | player_name | grand_slams_count |
| --------- | ----------- | ----------------- |

### **Example Input**

#### `Players`

| player_id | player_name |
| --------- | ----------- |
| 1         | Novak       |
| 2         | Rafael      |
| 3         | Roger       |
| 4         | Andy        |

#### `Championships`

| year | Wimbledon | Fr_open | US_open | Au_open |
| ---- | --------- | ------- | ------- | ------- |
| 2018 | 1         | 2       | 3       | 4       |
| 2019 | 1         | 2       | 1       | 2       |
| 2020 | 2         | 2       | 3       | 4       |

### **Example Output**

| player_id | player_name | grand_slams_count |
| --------- | ----------- | ----------------- |
| 2         | Rafael      | 4                 |
| 1         | Novak       | 3                 |
| 3         | Roger       | 2                 |
| 4         | Andy        | 2                 |

**SOLUTION**:
```sql
WITH table1 AS (
  SELECT year, Wimbledon AS winner
  FROM Championships
  UNION ALL
  SELECT year, Fr_open AS winner
  FROM Championships
  UNION ALL
  SELECT year, US_open AS winner
  FROM Championships
  UNION ALL
  SELECT year, Au_open AS winner
  FROM Championships
),
table2 AS (
  SELECT winner, COUNT(year) AS slams_count
  FROM table1
  GROUP BY winner
)
SELECT  
  p.player_id, 
  p.player_name, 
  COALESCE(t.slams_count, 0) AS grand_slams_count
FROM Players p
LEFT JOIN table2 t
  ON p.player_id = t.winner
ORDER BY grand_slams_count DESC, player_name ASC;
```
