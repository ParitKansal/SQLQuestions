### ðŸ§  **Problem Description**

A salespersonâ€™s **influence** is defined as the **total sales amount** made by all their assigned customers.

The total sales amount for a customer =
sum of (`price Ã— quantity`) for all their orders.

You must **calculate the total influence** for each salesperson in the `Salesperson` table.

Return the result table containing:
| salesperson_id | name | total_influence |

If a salesperson has **no orders** (i.e., none of their customers placed any), the `total_influence` should be **0**.

Return the results in **any order**.

**SOLUTION**:
```sql
WITH table1 AS (
  SELECT  
      order_id, 
      customer_id, 
      quantity * price AS amount 
  FROM Orders
  LEFT JOIN Product 
      ON Orders.product_id = Product.product_id
),
table2 AS(
  SELECT 
      customer_id, 
      SUM(amount) AS Total
  FROM table1
  GROUP BY customer_id
),
table3 AS(
  SELECT Customer.customer_id, salesperson_id, Total
  FROM Customer
  LEFT JOIN table2
  ON Customer.customer_id = table2.customer_id
),
table4 AS(
SELECT  Salesperson.salesperson_id, Salesperson.name, 
  case
    WHEN table3.Total IS null
      then 0
    else
      table3.Total
  END AS total_influence
  -- table3.Total AS total_influence
  FROM Salesperson
  LEFT JOIN table3
  on Salesperson.salesperson_id = table3.salesperson_id
)
select salesperson_id, name, SUM(total_influence) AS total_influence
FROM table4
GROUP BY salesperson_id, name
```
