## ‚òéÔ∏è Problem: Number of Calls Between Two Persons

### **Table Schema**

#### `Calls`

```sql
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| from_id     | int     |
| to_id       | int     |
| duration    | int     |
+-------------+---------+
There is no primary key (multiple calls possible).
Each row represents a call between from_id and to_id with its duration in minutes.
```

---

### üß† **Problem Description**

Write an SQL query to find the **total number of calls** and the **total duration** between each unique pair of people.

* Calls are **bidirectional**:
  a call from A ‚Üí B is the same as a call from B ‚Üí A.
* Each pair should appear **only once** in the result.

Return the result table **ordered by person1_id, then person2_id**.

#### `Calls`

| from_id | to_id | duration |
| ------- | ----- | -------- |
| 1       | 2     | 59       |

```sql
WITH table1 AS (
  SELECT 
    duration,
    LEAST(from_id, to_id) AS person1,
    GREATEST(from_id, to_id) AS person2
  FROM Calls
)
SELECT
  person1 AS person1_id, 
  person2 AS person2_id, 
  COUNT(duration) AS call_count, 
  SUM(duration) AS total_duration
FROM table1
GROUP BY person1, person2
ORDER BY person1_id, person2_id;
